            <p>Jarrod Petree has spent his whole life throwing.The first things he threw, according to his mother,were assorted toys and a fair amount of food from thehighchair. Before long, he moved on to throwing balls.
            But from the very start, Jarrod had an especially determined arm.At least this is the view taken by his father, Tim,who played Division II baseball at the Florida Institute
            of Technology in the late 80's, graduating only a few years before his son was born: the kid basically arrived on earth wanting to throw.

            <p>Almost anyone who loves tennis and follows the men's tour on television has, over the last few years, had what might
            be termed Federer Moments. These are times, as you watch the young Swiss play, when the jaw drops and eyes protrude
            and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you're O.K.The Moments are more intense if you've
            played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do. We've all got our examples. Here is one.
